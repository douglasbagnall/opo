Opo:  a small Video Whale
=========================

Opo is designed to show synchronised full screen video on projectors
connected to multiple video cards.  It can also do other things, like
split video across a number of non-full-screen windows, but that is
sort of incidental.

Dependencies
============

Gstreamer 0.10
GTK/GDK 2.22

You need the dev packages.

Compiling
=========

Try `make`.

Usage
=====

#show a test picture split over 3 windows
./opo -F 2 -s 3

#split a picture full-screen across 4 monitors connected to 2 cards
./opo -c picture.avi -w 1024 -h 768 -x 2 -f -s 4

#see what else you can try
./opo --help

Name and history
================

In 2002 or before, Zeeshan Ali Khattak and others made a video wall
using Gstreamer and Xinerama[1][2].  They called it Video Whale.  To
run the 4x4 array of monitors, they had 4 computers with 4 video cards
in each, and a fifth computer that fed video to the others over the
network.  Opo was inspired by that project.

"Ngā Hau E Whā" is an artwork developed by Leilani Kake for the 2011
Auckland Arts Festival, to be shown at Fresh Gallery Otara[3].  It
requires four perfectly synchronised video projections.

"Opo" was a famous New Zealand dolphin[4].

This software was written for Leilani Kake's work, and Opo is a
conveniently short and available name for a small New Zealand Video
Whale.
